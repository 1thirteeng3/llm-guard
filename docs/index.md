**py-llm-shield** is a Python library designed to make interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) more robust, reliable, and structured.

Using the power and simplicity of Pydantic, `py-llm-shield` allows you to define data schemas and ensure that the output of an LLM conforms to those schemas, even if the output is unstructured text or malformed JSON.

### Main Features

* ✅ **Robust Validation:** Define the expected data structure using Pydantic classes.
* 🛠️ **Automatic Repair:** Automatically fixes JSONs with syntax errors.
* 🔎 **Smart Extraction:** Extracts structured data from plain text. * ⚙️ **Configurable:** Allows you to choose the AI ​​model and parameters for repair and extraction operations.
